## 0. Abstract



## 1. Requirements

Main package requirements:

- `CUDA == 11.1`
- `Python == 3.7.12`
- `PyTorch == 1.8.0`
- `PyTorch-Geometric == 2.0.0`

To install the complete requiring packages, use the following command at the root directory of the repository:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Quick Start
Just run the script corresponding to the experiment and dataset you want. For instance:

* Run out-of-distribution detection on all dataset pairs:
```bash
bash script/
```
